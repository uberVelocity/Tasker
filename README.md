## Technologies used

### Back-end /front end Server dependencies (so far)

- Node.js: Asynchronous single-threaded server used for dynamic websites
- Express.js: Minimal, unopinionated Node library
- AXIOS
- AJAX
- WebSockets: standardized protocol (W3C/IETF). Very good for handling lots of bytes per second. A live chat application makes use of web sockets since you need a duplex connection between server and users. **socket.io**
